//Graph LR - this is an optional special comment that requests TB (Top Bottom) or a LR (Left Right) flow diagram, the default is LR
// Extra formats can be selected using a | separated pair of terms - the format only needs to be defined the first time an entities is referenced
Dynamic Modeller	was created by	Joseph Padfield	object|actor
Dynamic Modeller	is based on	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid
Dynamic Modeller	designed to	"Allow users to create modelling flow-diagrams from simple lists of triples"
Dynamic Modeller	works with	Triples
// Comments can be added simply by starting a line with // or ##
Triples	are	Tab separated
Triples	have some	"Basic automatic formatting, but it is possible to force some further options using additional instructions after the third value in a given triple."
Dynamic Modeller	can also	"Start with data formatted as JSON, which is then automatically converted to Triples, please check the triples and report any errors in the conversion"
// Blank node can be added as shown
Dynamic Modeller	carries out	_BN	object|event_bn
_BN has type	Production
_BN	produces	Flow-diagrams
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Copying the triples and saving them as a text file."
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Bookmarking or copying the URL under the Bookmark button, after an update."
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	Saving an image	|event
Saving an image	has comment	"Following the link under the Get Image button an using the options provided."
Saving an image	is achieved using the	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor
