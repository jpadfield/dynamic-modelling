//Graph LR - this is an optional special comment that requests TB (Top Bottom) or a LR (Left Right) flow diagram, the default is LR
// Extra formats can be selected using a | separated pair of terms - the format only needs to be defined the first time an entities is referenced
Dynamic Modeller	was created by	Joseph Padfield	object|actor
Dynamic Modeller	is based on	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid
Dynamic Modeller	designed to	"Allow users to create modelling flow-diagrams from simple lists of triples"
Dynamic Modeller	works with	Triples
// Comments can be added simply by starting a line with // or ##
Triples	are	Tab separated
Triples	have some	"Basic automatic formatting, but it is possible to force some further options using additional instructions after the third value in a given triple
Triples	format examples	https://research.ng-london.org.uk/modelling/?example=example_formats"
Dynamic Modeller	can also	"Start with data formatted as JSON, which is then automatically converted to Triples, please check the triples and report any errors in the conversion"
// Blank node can be added as shown
Dynamic Modeller	carries out	_BN	object|event_bn
_BN has type	Production
_BN	produces	Flow-diagrams
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Copying the triples and saving them as a text file."
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Bookmarking or copying the URL under the Bookmark Link options, under the Links menu, after an update."
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	Saving an image	|event
Saving an image	has comment	"Following the link under the Get Image link, under the Links menu, and using the options provided."
Saving an image	is achieved using the	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor
