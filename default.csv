//The first line is an optional special comment that requests TB (Top Bottom) or a LR (Left Right) flow diagram, the default is LR - the style of the nodes linking the displayed concepts can also be adjusted with the addition or omission of the extra term "fix"
// Extra formats can be selected using a | separated pair of terms - the format only needs to be defined the first time an entities is referenced
Dynamic Modeller	was created by	Joseph Padfield|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2572-6428	object|actor
Dynamic Modeller	is based on	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid
Dynamic Modeller	can toggle	Zooming (toggle control in upper right of the model window)	|name2
Dynamic Modeller	designed to	"Allow users to create modelling flow-diagrams from simple lists of triples"
Dynamic Modeller	works with	Triples
Dynamic Modeller	can use	Subgraphs
Dynamic Modeller	allows the use of	Tooltips	|document
Tooltips	tooltip	Also known as hover text or labels
Tooltips	for example	Example Concept with a Tooltip	|thing
Example Concept with a Tooltip	tooltip	This approach can be used to hide comments on larger flow diagrams to simplify their appearance but without loosing the extra descriptions and information.
Tooltips	has comment	"Tooltips are added to link based nodes, with alternative texts, automatically, but they can also be added manually through an additional triple using the 'tooltip' property to link the item to the required text:<br/>Label  tooltip Required hover text "
Dynamic Modeller	can format	Links with alternative labels
Links with alternative labels	for example	Example Formats	|url
Links with alternative labels	has comment	"This can be achieved by adding the alternative label as a <b>'|'</b> separated suffix, such as:<br/>'ALT TEXT|https://full.url/or/link' "
Dynamic Modeller	uses	https://github.com/ariutta/svg-pan-zoom
https://github.com/ariutta/svg-pan-zoom	has comment	"svg-pan-zoom is used to allow users to use their mouse to navigate around and zoom in and out of larger models"
// Comments can be added simply by starting a line with // or ##
//subgraph Example Subgraph Title
Subgraphs	are	Grouped sections of a graph
Subgraphs	has comment	"Subgraph are started by adding a special comment  before the relevant triples - //Subgraph GROUP TITLE"<br/><br/>"The GROUP TITLE or subgraph label is optional and can be hidden using the following syntax - //Subgraph //GROUP TITLE"<br/><br/>"Alternatively the GROUP TITLE can be omitted completely - //Subgraph"
Subgraphs	has comment	"Subgraph are ended by adding a special comment  after the relevant triples - //end"
Subgraphs	can be nested as	Sub-Subgraphs
//subgraph Example Sub-Subgraph Title
Sub-Subgraphs	has comment	"Care needs to be taken to make sure which Subgraph nodes appear in, but it is possible to created nested sub-subgraphs simply by starting a new subgraph inside another one."
//end
//end
//subgraph Formatted Subgraph
Subgraphs	can be styled	Styled Subgraphs
Styled Subgraphs	has comment	"Any of the existing standard formats can automatically be applied to a subgraph by simply adding the name of the format after the //end line. For example this subgraph has been styled with the line //end base"
//end base
Triples	are	Tab separated	|type
Triples	have some	"Basic automatic formatting, but it is possible to force some further options using additional instructions after the third value in a given triple"
Triples	format examples	Example Formats|https://research.ng-london.org.uk/modelling/?example=example_formats
Dynamic Modeller	can also	"Start with data formatted as JSON, which is then automatically converted to Triples, please check the triples and report any errors in the conversion"
// Blank node can be added as shown
_BN	has type	Production	event_bn|
_BN	are allocated	"An automatic number each time the 'has type' property is used, so multiple _BN can be added to the list of triples and they will processed. All other properties will be allocated to the current _BN until a new 'has type' property is called."
Dynamic Modeller	carries out	_BN
_BN	produces	Flow-diagrams	|thing
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Copying the triples and saving them as a text file."
Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	"Bookmarking or copying the URL under the Bookmark Link options, under the Links menu, after an update."

Flow-diagrams	can be saved by	Downloading an image	|event
Downloading an image	has comment	"Following the link under the Download Image link, under the Links menu, and using the options provided."
Downloading an image	is achieved using	https://mermaid.ink/

Flow-diagrams	can also be edited in	The Mermaid Live Editor	|event
The Mermaid Live Editor	has comment	"Following the link under the Mermaid Editor link, under the Links menu, and using the options provided."
The Mermaid Live Editor	has url	https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor
_BN	has type	Author	actor_bn|
_BN	has comment	"New Blank Nodes, or any other entities can refer back to a previous Blank Node by adding a suffix to indicate how many Blank Nodes back one wants to refer to, i.e. the previous blank node would be referenced as '_BN-1' and the one before that would be '_BN-2' and so on."
_BN	assigned	_BN-1

Dynamic Modeller	can display	Free Font Awesome 5 Icons|https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/
Free Font Awesome 5 Icons	for example	far:fa-user-circle far:fa-heart fab:fa-creative-commons fas:fa-code
far:fa-user-circle far:fa-heart fab:fa-creative-commons fas:fa-code	has note	The Font Awesome icons can be added by formatting the icon details, provided on the Font Awesome website, like:<br/>far : fa-user-circle<br/>(without the spaces around the colon).
