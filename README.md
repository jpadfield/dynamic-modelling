# dynamic-modelling
This is an interactive live modelling system which can automatically convert simple tab separated triples into graphical models using the [mermaid library](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid).  

## Instructions
Full details and instructions relating to how this system works is still being developed, however several examples are included in the interactive web site: [dynamic modelling](https://research.ng-london.org.uk/modelling/), with all of the related code presented here in [GitHub](https://github.com/jpadfield/dynamic-modelling).
